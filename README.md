Intergalactic Trade Network Backend System

Overview
This backend system is designed to handle trade transactions, manage space cargo, and track inventory across multiple planets and space stations. It supports high throughput data, real-time updates, and efficient event processing.

High-Level Architecture
API Gateway: Routes requests, handles authentication.
Trade Service: Manages buying/selling transactions.
Cargo Service: Handles cargo shipments and status updates.
Inventory Service: Tracks inventory levels at space stations and planets.
Event Processor: Ingests and processes real-time events.
Real-Time Updates Service: Delivers real-time updates to clients.
Dashboard Service: Provides real-time analytics and visualizations.

Database Schema and Storage
Database: Choose a database (e.g., SQL or NoSQL) for high-volume data and real-time processing.
Ingestion: Optimize for high-throughput data ingestion.
Querying: Implement efficient indexing and querying strategies.

Event Processing
Pipeline: Ingests trade and cargo events.
Processing: Updates inventory and shipment status in real-time.
Notifications: Alerts for critical events like delayed shipments.

API Design
POST /api/trades: Initiate a new trade transaction.
GET /api/trades/{transactionId}: Retrieve trade transaction details.
POST /api/cargo: Create a new cargo shipment.
GET /api/cargo/{shipmentId}: Retrieve cargo shipment details.
GET /api/inventory/{stationId}: Retrieve inventory levels.
GET /api/updates/real-time: Get real-time updates on trade and cargo.

Real-Time Analytics
Dashboard: Displays metrics, charts, and maps.
Updates: Handles frequent updates and large data volumes.

Code Implementation
Best Practices: Follow modularity, error handling, and security practices.
Testing: Include unit and integration tests.

Deployment
Cloud Provider: Deployed on [AWS/Render/etc.].
Instructions: Follow setup and deployment instructions provided below.

Setup and Deployment
Clone the Repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install Dependencies: npm install or pip install -r requirements.txt
Environment Configuration: Set up environment variables as per .env.example.
Start Services: Use Docker Compose or specified command to start the services.
Run Migrations: Apply database migrations.

Testing
API Testing: Use tools like Postman or curl to test endpoints.
Unit Tests: Run npm test or pytest for unit tests.

Documentation
Design Choices: Refer to design decisions in the architectural overview.
Known Limitations: Document limitations and potential improvements.
Scalability and Performance (Bonus Points)
Scaling Strategies: Implement load balancing, horizontal scaling.
Optimization: Use caching (e.g., Redis), data partitioning, and indexing.
